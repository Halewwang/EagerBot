/**
 * Which credential a custom server is allowed to be pointed at.
 *
 * `addCustomServer` takes the pointer from the request body, and the add itself dereferences it: the
 * refresh that follows decrypts whatever it names and sends it to the URL from the same request. So
 * the pointer is the whole control. An administrator naming somebody's `mcp_user_token` was enough
 * to have that person's decrypted token delivered to an address the administrator chose, before any
 * grant, policy check or Bot existed.
 *
 * `POST /api/admin/credentials` already refuses to *mint* a `mcp_user_token` by hand, and says why:
 * it would be "creating a credential attributed to a person who never agreed to it". Pointing at one
 * spends that credential on the same person's behalf, which is the same objection.
