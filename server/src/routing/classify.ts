/**
 * Choosing which coworker an untagged message is for.
 *
 * A channel is pinned to one coworker for the life of its thread, and the pin is set before the
 * first turn runs, so this decision happens at channel creation, not during a run. When the person
 * named a coworker with `@`, there is nothing to decide and this is never called. When they did not,
 * this reads the message against what each coworker is for and picks one.
 *
 * The model call is injected rather than made here, so the part that matters — what happens when the
 * answer is missing, malformed, or names a coworker that is not on the roster — is a plain function
 * with no network in the way. Every one of those failure paths lands on the deployment's default
 * coworker and says so; nothing here ever throws, because a router that throws would turn "we were
 * not sure who to ask" into "your message went nowhere".
